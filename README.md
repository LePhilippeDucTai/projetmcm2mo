## Summary ##
This repository contains our Monte-Carlo project on calculating a Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk (expected shortfall) using an Importance Sampling method in order to reduce the variance on the VaR Monte-Carlo estimate. We rely our work on this article : Recursive Computation of Value-at-Risk and Conditional Value-at-Risk using MC and QMC, written by 
Olivier Bardou, Noufel Frikha, and Gilles Pag√®s.

## Compiling ##
Once this has been done, run on terminal the following commands :
